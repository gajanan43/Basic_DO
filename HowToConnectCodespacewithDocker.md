## ✅ Push Docker Image to Your Docker Hub Account

Let's assume:

* Your Docker Hub **username** is: `gajanan43`
* Your local Docker image is: `hellow-python`

---

### 🔹 Step 1: Log in to Docker Hub

If you're not already logged in with **your account**, run:

```bash
docker logout
docker login
```

Then enter:

* **Username**: `gajanan43`
* **Password**: Your Docker Hub password

  > 🔐 If you have 2FA enabled, use a **Docker Access Token** (from: [https://hub.docker.com/settings/security](https://hub.docker.com/settings/security))

---

### 🔹 Step 2: Tag Your Image with Your Docker Hub Username

Docker requires images to be tagged as:

```bash
<your-username>/<image-name>:<tag>
```

So tag your image like this:

```bash
docker tag hellow-python gajanan43/hellow-python:latest
```

> Replace `hellow-python` with whatever your image is named.

---

### 🔹 Step 3: Push the Image to Docker Hub

Now push it to your account:

```bash
docker push gajanan43/hellow-python:latest
```

✅ You should see something like:

```
The push refers to repository [docker.io/gajanan43/hellow-python]
XXXXXX: Pushed
YYYYYY: Pushed
latest: digest: sha256:xxxxxxx size: 1234
```

---

### 🔹 Step 4: Verify on Docker Hub

Go to:
👉 [https://hub.docker.com/repositories](https://hub.docker.com/repositories)

You should now see:

* Repository name: `hellow-python`
* Under your account (`gajanan43`)

---

## ✅ Summary of Commands

```bash
docker logout
docker login                        # Use your Docker Hub account
docker tag hellow-python gajanan43/hellow-python:latest
docker push gajanan43/hellow-python:latest
```

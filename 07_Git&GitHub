## What is a Version Control System (VCS)?

A Version Control System (VCS) is a tool that helps manage changes to files, especially code, over time. 
It keeps track of every modification made to the codebase, so you can:

- ```View the history``` of changes
- ```Revert``` to previous versions if needed
- ```Collaborate``` with others without overwriting each otherâ€™s work


### Types of Version Control Systems:

1. **Local VCS**: Stores versions on a local system (e.g., RCS).
2. **Centralized VCS**: Uses a central server (e.g., SVN, CVS).
3. **Distributed VCS**: Every user has a full copy of the repository (e.g., **Git**).


## Key Features of a VCS:

* **Tracking changes** in files (who changed what and when)
* **Branching and merging** to allow simultaneous work on different features
* **Backup and recovery** by storing historical versions
* **Collaboration** among multiple developers


### Popular VCS Tools:

* **Git** (most popular, distributed)
* **Subversion (SVN)** (centralized)
* **Mercurial**
* **Perforce**

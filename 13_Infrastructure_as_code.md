### ✅ What is Terraform?

**Terraform** is an open-source **Infrastructure as Code (IaC)** tool created by **HashiCorp** that allows you to **define, provision, and manage infrastructure** across various cloud providers and services using a simple, declarative language called **HashiCorp Configuration Language (HCL)**.

### 💡 Why Use Terraform?

Terraform helps you:

* **Automate** cloud infrastructure setup.
* Ensure **consistency** in infrastructure.
* Enable **version control** for infrastructure (just like code).
* Manage **multi-cloud** environments (AWS, Azure, GCP, etc.) from one tool.

### 🛠️ Key Features of Terraform

| Feature              | Description                                                     |
| -------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **IaC**              | Define infrastructure in code format (HCL).                     |
| **Idempotent**       | Running the same code gives the same result (no duplication).   |
| **Provider-based**   | Supports many providers (AWS, Azure, Kubernetes, GitHub, etc.). |
| **State Management** | Tracks real-world resources using a `.tfstate` file.            |
| **Modular**          | Supports reuse via **modules** (like functions in programming). |

### 🔄 Terraform Workflow

1. **Write**: Create `.tf` configuration files.
2. **Initialize**: Run `terraform init` to prepare Terraform.
3. **Plan**: Run `terraform plan` to preview changes.
4. **Apply**: Run `terraform apply` to make the changes real.
5. **Destroy**: Run `terraform destroy` to delete infrastructure.


### 📦 Terraform Components

| Component    | Description                                        |
| ------------ | -------------------------------------------------- |
| **Provider** | Cloud or service provider (e.g., AWS, Azure, GCP). |
| **Resource** | Infrastructure component (e.g., VM, DB, network).  |
| **Module**   | A group of resources used together.                |
| **Variable** | Input value to make config flexible.               |
| **State**    | Stores current infrastructure status.              |

### 🚀 Benefits of Terraform

* Platform agnostic: supports **multiple clouds**.
* Reduces human error with **automation**.
* Improves team collaboration with **version control** (Git).
* Makes **rollback and recovery** easier.

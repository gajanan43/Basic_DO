## What is a Version Control System (VCS)?

A Version Control System (VCS) is a tool that helps manage changes to files, especially code, over time. 
It keeps track of every modification made to the codebase, so you can:

- ```View the history``` of changes
- ```Revert``` to previous versions if needed
- ```Collaborate``` with others without overwriting each otherâ€™s work


### Types of Version Control Systems:

1. **Local VCS**: Stores versions on a local system (e.g., RCS).
2. **Centralized VCS**: Uses a central server (e.g., SVN, CVS).
3. **Distributed VCS**: Every user has a full copy of the repository (e.g., **Git**).


## Key Features of a VCS:

* **Tracking changes** in files (who changed what and when)
* **Branching and merging** to allow simultaneous work on different features
* **Backup and recovery** by storing historical versions
* **Collaboration** among multiple developers


### Popular VCS Tools:

* **Git** (most popular, distributed)
* **Subversion (SVN)** (centralized)
* **Mercurial**
* **Perforce**


## Centralized Version Control System (CVCS)

* There is **one central server** where all the code and history are stored.
* Developers **connect to this server** to get the latest code or share their changes.
* If the **server goes down**, no one can collaborate or access the code.

**Example:** SVN (Subversion), CVS

#### Think of it like:

A classroom with **one whiteboard** (the server). Everyone must go to that whiteboard to see or update information. If the whiteboard is gone, no one can work.


## ðŸ”¹ Distributed Version Control System (DVCS)

* Every developer has a **full copy of the entire project**, including the history.
* You can **work offline** â€” commit changes, switch branches, and view history.
* When ready, you can **sync with others** using a remote server (like GitHub).

**Example:** Git, Mercurial

####  Think of it like:

Every student in the classroom has their **own notebook** with a full copy of the whiteboard. They can work on their own and later share updates with each other.

## What is Git?

**Git** is a **distributed version control system** used to track changes in source code during software development. It allows multiple developers to work on a project simultaneously without interfering with each other's work. Git helps manage versions, collaborate on code, and keep a history of all changes made to a project.

**Key features of Git:**

* **Distributed**: Every developer has a complete copy of the project repository.
* **Version Control**: Tracks code changes and allows reverting to previous versions.
* **Branching and Merging**: Developers can work in isolated branches and merge them later.
* **Speed and Efficiency**: Git performs operations like commits, merges, and diffs very quickly.

| Command               | Description                                |
| --------------------- | ------------------------------------------ |
| `git init`            | Initialize a new Git repository            |
| `git clone <url>`     | Copy a remote repository                   |
| `git status`          | Show the current state of the repo         |
| `git add <file>`      | Stage a file for commit                    |
| `git commit -m "msg"` | Save a snapshot with a message             |
| `git push`            | Send changes to remote repo                |
| `git pull`            | Get updates from remote repo               |
| `git branch`          | List or create branches                    |
| `git merge`           | Combine changes from one branch to another |


## What is GitHub?

**GitHub** is a **web-based platform** that uses Git for version control and provides a user-friendly interface for hosting, sharing, and collaborating on Git repositories. Itâ€™s a popular platform for open-source and private software projects.

**Key features of GitHub:**

* **Remote Git Repositories**: Stores code online so teams can collaborate from anywhere.
* **Collaboration Tools**: Includes pull requests, issues, and project boards.
* **Community and Open Source**: Allows users to explore and contribute to public repositories.
* **CI/CD Integration**: Supports continuous integration and deployment pipelines.
* **Security and Access Control**: Provides permissions and role management for teams.
